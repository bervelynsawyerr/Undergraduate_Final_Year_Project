## Project Description:

This application is called OwnChain. 
Property/land registry in Ghana as well as in many parts of the world is a very slow and inconvenient process. Current property/land registration & verification systems include an increasing number of fraud cases and loss of paperwork and court cases due to thousands of land records to maintain.  
The intuition behind building this was to make the process of property/land registration resilient and decreases the cases of fraud in the process. Using the system, validation of the properties/lands is also possible as immutable transactions are being stored in the public ledger.  
So the Property Ownership Verification System using blockchain and NFTs is a distributed system that will store all the transactions made during the process of property/land buying. This will also be helpful for buyers, sellers and government registrars to transfer the property/land ownership from seller to new buyer as well as it will accelerate the process of registration and ownership.
